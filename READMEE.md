## INTRODUCTION
With an online weather prediction and monitoring system, real-time weather forecasting, analysis, and visualization are all feasible.Agriculture is the principal source of earnings in the majority of African countries. When it comes to agricultural productivity and weather, a good rainy season equates to a healthy economy, whereas terrible weather equates to poverty and death. As a result of precise, trustworthy, and timely weather forecasts, farmers can make more informed decisions regarding when, what, and how to plant.
